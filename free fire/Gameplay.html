          <p class="b" >Asynchronous multiplayer is a form of multiplayer gameplay where players do not have
          to be playing at the same time.[10] This form of multiplayer game has its origins in play-by-mail
          games, where players would send their moves through postal mail to a game master, who then would 
          compile and send out results for the next turn. Play-by-mail games transitioned to electronic 
          form as play-by-email games.[11] Similar games were developed for bulletin board systems, such 
          as Trade Wars, where the turn structure may not be as rigorous and allow players to take actions
          at any time in a persistence space alongside all other players, a concept known as sporadic pla.[12]
          These types of asynchronous multiplayer games waned with the widespread availability of the 
          Internet which allowed players to play against each other simultaneously, but remains an option
           in many strategy-related games, such as the Civilization series. Coordination of turns are 
           subsequently managed by one computer or a centralized server. Further, many mobile games are 
           based on sporadic play and use social interactions with other players, lacking direct player 
           versus player game modes but allowing players to influence other players' games, coordinated 
           through central game servers, another facet of asynchronous play.[12]</p>

          <p class="b" >Cooperative video game, often abbreviated as co-op, is a video game that allows
             players to work together as teammates, usually against one or more non-player character opponents (PvE).
            It is distinct from other multiplayer modes, such as competitive multiplayer modes like player
             versus player (PvP) or deathmatch. Playing simultaneously allows players to assist one another 
             in many ways: passing weapons or items, healing, providing covering fire in a firefight, and 
             performing cooperative maneuvers such as boosting a teammate up and over obstacles.
            In its most simple form, cooperative gameplay modifies the single player mode of a game, 
            sometimes with broader modifications to the story and gameplay. Examples include beat 'em up 
            games such as Double Dragon, Streets of Rage, and Die Hard Arcade. Other co-op games are designed 
            for cooperative gameplay, with each player taking a special role in gameplay, or alternatively 
            take advantage of having multiple players in an impactful way on gameplay. Example for such games 
            include the Left 4 Dead and the Payday series.
          Co-op games can be played over a network via a local area networks or wide area networks, 
            such as in the Destiny and Borderlands series, while other co-op games can be played locally
             using one or multiple input controllers, with It Takes Two as an example. Some games such as 
             Mario Kart Wii and Call of Duty's co-op modes allow two players from the same console to play 
             with others online.</p>

      <p id="Emergent gameplay"><h2 style="color:rgb(212, 69, 2) ;font-size:x-large;"> Emergent gameplay</h2>
      <p class="b" >Immersive sims, such as Deus Ex and System Shock,
         are games built around emergent gameplay. These games give the player-character a range 
         of abilities and tools, and a consistent game world established by rules, but do not enforce
         any specific solution onto the player, though the player may be guided into suggested solutions.
        To move past a guard blocking a door, the player could opt to directly attack the guard, sneak up
      and knock the guard unconscious, distract the guard to move away from their post, or use parkour 
        to reach an alternate opening well out of sight, among other solutions. In such games, it may be 
         possible to complete in-game problems using solutions that the game designers did not foresee; 
        for example in Deus Ex, designers were surprised to find players using wall-mounted mines as 
        pitons for climbing walls.[2] A similar concept exists for roguelike games, where emergent 
        gameplay is considered a high-value factor by the 2008 Berlin Interpretation for roguelikes.[3]
Such emergence may also occur in games through open-ended gameplay and shee
 weight of simulated content, in Minecraft, Dwarf Fortress or Space Station 13.
  These games do not have any endgame criteria though like immersive sims present a
   consistent, rule-based world, but will often present the player with tutorials of what they
    could do within the game. From this, players may follow the intended way to play the game,
     or can veer in completely different directions, such as extravagant simulated machines within Minecraft.

      <p id="Nonlinear gameplay"><h2 style="color:rgb(212, 69, 2) ;font-size:x-large;"> Nonlinear gameplay </h2>
      <p class="b" >A game level or world can be linear, nonlinear or interactive. 
        In a linear game, there is only one path that the player must take through the level, however, 
        in games with nonlinear gameplay, players might have to revisit locations or choose from
         multiple paths to finish the level. As with other game elements, linear level design is not absolute
          While a nonlinear level can 
        give the freedom to explore or backtrack, there can be a sequence of challenges that a player must 
        solve to complete the level. If a player must confront the challenges in a fixed order nonlinear games
         will often give multiple approaches to achieve said objectives.
       A more linear game requires a player to finish levels in a fixed sequence to win. 
        The ability to skip, repeat, or choose between levels makes this type of game less linear. 
        Super Mario Bros. is an early example of this, where the player had access to warp zones that 
        skipped many levels of the game.
         In some games, levels can change between linear design and free roaming depending on the 
        objective of the stage. Super Mario 64 is an example where the main stages are free roam, 
        while the levels where Bowser is encountered follow a straight path to the end.</p>
